# Problem #1: List Practice
# Now practice writing code with lists! Implement the functionality described in the comments below.

# def main(): # Create a list called fruit_list that contains the following fruits: # 'apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'pineapple'.

# Print the length of the list.


# Add 'mango' at the end of the list. 


# Print the updated list.
def main():

    fruit_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'watermelon', 'grapes', 'pineapple']

    print("Length of the list:", len(fruit_list))

    fruit_list.append('mango')

    print("Updated list:")
    for fruit in fruit_list:
        print(fruit)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
