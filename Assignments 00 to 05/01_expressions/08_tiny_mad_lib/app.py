# roblem Statement
# Write a program which prompts the user for an adjective, then a noun, then a verb, and then prints a fun sentence with those words!

# Mad Libs is a word game where players are prompted for one word at a time, and the words are eventually filled into the blanks of a word template to make an entertaining story! We've provided you with the beginning of a sentence (the SENTENCE_START constant) which will end in a user-inputted adjective, noun, and then verb.

# Here's a sample run (user input is in bold italics):

# Please type an adjective and press enter. tiny

# Please type a noun and press enter. plant

# Please type a verb and press enter. fly

# Code in Place is fun. I learned to program and used Python to make my tiny plant fly!
